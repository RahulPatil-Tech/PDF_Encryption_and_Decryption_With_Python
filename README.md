# PDF Encryption & Decryption with Python

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt PDF files using the PyPDF2 library. The script provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to select a PDF file, enter a password, and perform encryption or decryption operations.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyPDF2 library

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/RahulPatil-Tech/PDF_Encryption_and_Decryption_with_Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd pdf-encryption-decryption-python
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```shell
   pip install PyPDF2
   pip install tk
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```shell
   App.py
